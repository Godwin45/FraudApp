## Key Features

### Accurate Predictions
Our machine learning model has been trained on a comprehensive and diverse dataset, enabling it to make accurate predictions and identify potential fraudulent transactions with high confidence.

### User-Friendly Interface
We've prioritized user experience by creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Users can easily input transaction details and receive instant predictions, making it a powerful tool for fraud prevention.

### Comprehensive Machine Learning Pipeline
The app incorporates a well-structured machine learning pipeline. From data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment, every step has been thoughtfully implemented to ensure reliable results.

### MLflow Integration
We use MLflow to manage the end-to-end machine learning workflow. Experiment tracking, model versioning, and reproducibility are seamlessly handled using MLflow, ensuring transparency and traceability.

### Dockerized Deployment
Our app is containerized using Docker, allowing for consistent and seamless deployment across various environments. Dockerization enhances scalability and simplifies deployment for both developers and operations teams.

### AWS Deployment
The app is deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to ensure scalability, reliability, and global accessibility. AWS provides the foundation for robust and high-performance deployment of our app.
